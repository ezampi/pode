About
=======

It all began in 1969, when Bob Balzer implemented a version of omniscient debugging for Fortran.

From [1]:

> Omniscient debugging describes the concept that debuggers should know everything about the run of a program,
> that they should remember every state change, and be able to present to you the value of any variable at any
> point in time. Essentially, omniscient debugging means that you can go backwards in time.

Inspired by the article "Omniscient Debbuging - an easier way to find program bugs" by Bil Lewis [1],
I decided to explore the issue in Python.
This project is an informal exploration on the subject.



Architecture
============

    +----------+   +----------+    +-------+   +---------+
    | Inferior |==>| Event    |==> | Event |<->|  Info   |
    | Process  |   | Recorder |    |   DB  |   | Browser |
    +----------+   +----------+    +-------+   +---------+

 The process being debugged is called the **inferior process**.
 The **event recorder** is responsible for monitoring the inferior processes to detect events.
 These events are recorded in the **event database**.
 The **info browser** queries the event database and displays information related to the recorded events.


Strategies
==========

My first strategy is to leverage sys.settrace as the main hook in the Python Virtual Machine (PVM) to record events.
A function registered with sys.settrace will act as event recorder.
There can be many event database backends. The main requirement is support for fast data insertions (write operations).
I would like to explore Redis, ElasticSearch and Neo4J as backends.
Moreover, I will use a regular Web browser to build the *info browser*.

For the time being, we are not resorting to application code instrumentation.
